First off, thank you for purchasing this product.

While it is possible to set this up manually, for convenience the script will automatically
retrieve all the nessacery prefabs and files needed to run properly.

To add this to your project, simply create an Empty GameObject, and drag the Spawner script
from the library located in the scripts folder.

Included is a Demo scene, which shows you the simplistic layout of the system.

Current Feature Set:
1) Visualize the bounds of your universe.

2) Complete random generation of starfields and nebulas.

3) Use your own textures for the nebula and starfield.

4) Support for random textures using Texture Animation Sheet in the nebula.

Note: To make use of the random textures in the nebula, change the texture on the
material, then on the prefab, scroll down on the particle system till you see the
Texture Animation Sheet section, then change the Y value to the ammount of textures
you have in your sheet. The default is set to 8.

Please note: 

Due to floating point limitations, the maximum size for the system is locked to
up to 100 000. Which needs to be multiplied by 2 then cubed to get your actual world size.
